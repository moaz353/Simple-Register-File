# Register file 

## Overview 

### This project implements a Register File module designed for use in digital systems, such as processors or custom memory controllers. The Register File provides a mechanism for reading and writing data to and from an internal memory block based on address inputs, making it a fundamental building block for handling data storage and retrieval in many hardware designs. The module allows efficient memory management through synchronous read and write operations triggered by a clock signal, while also supporting reset functionality for system initialization.
